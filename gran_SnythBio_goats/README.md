.pl scripts read an array of amino acid abbreviations and maps them to a MIDI mapping declared in %acid_map

script prints to .CSV ready to be used in conjunction with MIDICSV_template.ods, content of script fills columns C - F, from row 11 onwards


mapping uses initials of amino acids rather than 3 letter abbreviations in order that sequence to be converted can be stored as in-script array

utilises the MIDICSV executable available at http://www.fourmilab.ch/webtools/midicsv/.
